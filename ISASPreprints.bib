  abstract = {We propose a homotopy continuation method called FLUX for approximating
              complicated probability density functions. It is based on progressive
              processing for smoothly morphing a given density into the desired one.
              Distributed ordinary differential equations (DODEs) with an artificial time
              $\gamma \in [0,1]$ are derived for describing the evolution from the initial
              density to the desired final density. For a finite-dimensional
              parametrization, the DODEs are converted to a system of ordinary
              differential equations (SODEs), which are solved for $\gamma \in [0,1]$ and
              return the desired result for $\gamma=1$. This includes parametric
              representations such as Gaussians or Gaussian mixtures and nonparametric
              setups such as sample sets. In the latter case, we obtain a particle flow
              between the two densities along the artificial time.
              FLUX is applied to state estimation in stochastic nonlinear dynamic
              systems by gradual inclusion of measurement information. The proposed
              approximation method (1) is fast, (2) can be applied to arbitrary nonlinear
              systems and is not limited to additive noise, (3) allows for target
              densities that are only known at certain points, (4) does not require
              optimization, (5) does not require the solution of partial differential
              equations, and (6) works with standard procedures for solving SODEs. This
              manuscript is limited to the one-dimensional case and a fixed number of
              parameters during the progression.
              Future extensions will include consideration of higher dimensions and on the
              fly adaption of the number of parameters.}

              Kalman Filter (S2KF) with a new point symmetric Gaussian sampling 
              scheme. This not only improves the S2KF's estimation quality, but also 
              reduces the time needed to compute the required optimal Gaussian samples 
              drastically. Moreover, we improve the numerical stability of the sample

              thousand-dimensional Gaussian distribution using tens of thousands of 
              optimally placed samples. We evaluate the new symmetric S2KF by 
              computing higher-order moments of standard normal distributions and

              usually tackled with traditional nonlinear filtering techniques such
              as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) or the unscented Kalman filter
              (UKF). Most of these techniques assume Gaussian distributions to
              account for system noise and uncertain measurements. This distributional

              uncertainty. We propose a filter that considers the periodicity of
              the orientation estimation problem in its distributional assumption.
              This is achieved by making use of the Bingham distribution, which
              is defined on the hypersphere and thus inherently more suitable to
              periodic problems. Furthermore, handling of non-trivial system functions

  abstract = {In this paper, a unified approach to sequence-based control and estimation
              of linear networked systems with multiple sensors is proposed. Time
              delays and data losses in the controller-actuator-channel are compensated
              by sending sequences of  control inputs. The sequence-based design
              paradigm is further extended to the sensor-controller-channels without
              increasing the load of the network. In this context, we present a
              recursive solution based on the Hypothesizing Distributed Kalman
              Filter (HKF) that is included in the overall sequence-based controller
              design.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of sequence-based controller design for Networked Control Systems (NCS), 
              where control inputs and measurements are transmitted over TCP-like network connections that are subject to stochastic 
              packet losses and time-varying packet delays. At every time step, the controller sends a sequence of predicted control 
              inputs to the actuator in addition to the current control input. In this sequence-based setup, we derive an optimal 
              solution to the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem and prove that the separation principle holds. 
              Simulations demonstrate the improved performance of this optimal controller compared to other sequence-based approaches.},

  abstract = {We propose a principled algorithm for robust Bayesian filtering and
              smoothing in nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems when both the transition
              function and the measurement function are described by non-parametric
              Gaussian process (GP) models. GPs are gaining increasing importance
              in signal processing, machine learning, robotics, and control for
              representing unknown system functions by posterior probability distributions.
              This modern way of "system identification" is more robust than finding
              point estimates of a parametric function representation. In this
              article, we present a principled algorithm for robust analytic smoothing
              in GP dynamic systems, which are increasingly used in robotics and
              control. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate the robustness of
              the proposed approach in situations where other state-of-the-art

              the measurement information is continuously included into the given
              prior estimate (although we perform observations at discrete time

              differential equations (ODE) by employing a new coupled density representation
              comprising a Gaussian density and its Dirac Mixture approximation.
              The ODE is used for continuously tracking the true non-Gaussian posterior
              by its best matching Gaussian approximation. The performance of the

  abstract = {A combination of a telepresence system and a microscopic traffic simulator
              is introduced. It is evaluated using a hotel evacuation scenario.
              Four different kinds of supporting information are compared, standard
              exit signs, floor plans with indicated exit routes, guiding lines
              on the floor and simulated agents leading the way. The results indicate
              that guiding lines are the most efficient way to support an evacuation

              another level the results are consistent with previously performed
              real and virtual experiments and validate the use of a telepresence
              system in evacuation studies. It is shown that using a microscopic
              traffic simulator extends the possibilities for evaluation, e.g.

  journal  = {arXiv preprint: Systems and Control (cs.SY)},

  abstract = {We consider stochastic model predictive control of a multi-agent systems
              with constraints on the probabilities of inter-agent collisions.
              We first study a sample-based approximation of the collision probabilities
              and use this approximation to formulate constraints for the stochastic
              control problem. This approximation will converge as the number of
              samples goes to infinity, however, the complexity of the resulting
              control problem is so high that this approach proves unsuitable for
              control under real-time requirements. To alleviate the computational
              burden we propose a second approach that uses probabilistic bounds
              to determine regions with increased probability of presence for each
              agent and formulate constraints for the control problem that guarantee
              that these regions will not overlap. We prove that the resulting
              problem is conservative for the original problem with probabilistic
              constraints, ie. every control strategy that is feasible under our
              new constraints will automatically be feasible for the original problem.
              Furthermore we show in simulations in a UAV path planning scenario
              that our proposed approach grants significantly better run-time performance
              compared to a controller with the sample-based approximation with
              only a small degree of sub-optimality resulting from the conservativeness
