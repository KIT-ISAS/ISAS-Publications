 abstract = {The programming of manipulators is a common task in robotics, for which numerous solutions exist. In this work, a new programming method related to the common master-slave approach is introduced, in which the master is replaced by a digital twin created through haptic and visual rendering. To achieve this, we present an algorithm that enables the haptic rendering of any programmed robot with a serial manipulator on a general-purpose haptic interface. The results show that the proposed haptic rendering reproduces the kinematic properties of the programmed robot and directly provides the desired joint space trajectories. In addition to a stand-alone usage, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be easily paired with existing visual technology for virtual and augmented reality to facilitate a highly immersive programming experience.},

 abstract = {Automatic quality control has long been an integral part of the processing of food and agricultural products. Visual inspection offers solutions for many issues in this context and can be employed in the form of sensor-based sorting to automatically remove foreign and low quality entities from a product stream. However, these methods are limited to defects that can be made visible by the employed sensor, which usually restricts the system to defects appearing on the surface. An alternative non-visual solution lies in impact-acoustic methods, which do not suffer from this constraint. However, these are strongly limited in terms of material throughput and consequently not suitable for large scale industrial application. In this paper, we present a novel approach that performs inspection based on optically acquired motion data. A high-speed camera captures image sequences of test objects during a transportation process on a chute with a specific structured surface. The trajectory data is then used to classify test objects based on their motion behavior. The approach is evaluated experimentally on the example of distinguishing defect-free hazelnuts from ones that suffer from insect damage. Results show that by merely utilizing the motion data, a recognition rate of up to 80% for undamaged hazelnuts can be achieved. A major advantage of our approach is that it can be integrated in sensor-based sorting systems and is suitable for high throughput applications.},

 abstract = {Despite significant advances in robot autonomy, manual intervention by a human operator is necessary in many situations. This usually requires qualified staff and some robot-specific input device even for the comparatively simple case of platform locomotion. For this reason, we propose a novel path generation method applicable to car-like vehicles. With this method, the operator “draws” a desired 2D path by walking in a large-scale haptic interface while a guiding force is exerted, which ensures that the generated path can later be accurately followed by a path tracking controller running offline on a remote robot. We present a local optimization-based path planner, a higher-level path generation algorithm utilizing the aforementioned planner, and a force feedback law. Experiments show improved feasibility of the generated paths without affecting the operator's ability to make decisions independently.},

 abstract = {Fast covariance intersection is a widespread technique for state estimate fusion in sensor networks when cross-correlations are not known and fast computations are desired. The common requirement of sending estimates from one party to another during fusion forfeits local privacy. Current secure fusion algorithms rely on encryption schemes that do not provide sufficient flexibility. As a result, excess communication between estimate producers is required, which is often undesirable. We propose a novel method of homomorphically computing the fast covariance intersection algorithm on estimates encrypted with a combination of encryption schemes. Using order revealing encryption, we show how an approximate solution to the fast covariance intersection weights can be computed and combined with partially homomorphic encryptions of estimates, to calculate an encryption of the fused result. The described approach allows secure fusion of any number of private estimates, making third-party cloud processing a viable option when working with sensitive state estimates or when performing estimation over untrusted networks.},

 abstract = {In this paper a train localization method is proposed that uses local variations of the earth magnetic field to determine the topological position of a train in a track network. The approach requires a magnetometer triad, an accelerometer, and a map of the magnetic field along the railway tracks. The estimated topological position comprises the along-track position that defines the position of the train within a certain track and the track ID that specifies the track the train is driving on. The along-track position is estimated by a a recursive Bayesian filter and the track ID is found from a hypothesis test. In particular the use of multiple particle filter, each estimating the position on different track hypothesis, is proposed. Whenever the estimated train position crosses a switch, a particle filter for each possible track is created. With the position estimates of the different filters, the likelihood for each track hypothesis is calculated from the measured magnetic field and the expected magnetic field in the map. A comparison of the likelihoods is subsequently used to decide which track is the most likely. After a decision for a track is made, the unnecessary filters are deleted. The feasibility of the proposed localization method is evaluated with measurement data recorded on a regional train. In the evaluation, the localization method was running in real time and overall an RMSE below five meter could be achieved and all tracks were correctly identified.},

 abstract = {With modern communication technology, sensors, estimators, and controllers can be pushed apart to distribute 
intelligence over wide distances. Instead of congesting channels by periodic data transmissions, smart sensors can decide 
on their own whether data are worth transmitting. This paper studies event-based transmissions from sensor to estimator. 
The sensor-side event trigger conveys usable information even if no transmission is triggered. In the absence of data, 
such implicit information can still be exploited by the remote Kalman filter. For this purpose, an easy-to-implement 
triggering mechanism is proposed based on a Finite Impulse Response prediction that is compared against a stochastic 
decision variable. By the aid of the stochastic event trigger, the implicit information retains a Gaussian representation 
and can easily be processed by the Kalman filter. The parameters for the stochastic trigger are retrieved from the 
Finite Impulse Response filter, which contributes to reducing the communication rate significantly, as shown in simulations.},

 abstract = {Decentralized data fusion is a challenging task even for 
linear estimation problems. Nonlinear estimation renders data fusion 
even more difficult as dependencies among the nonlinear estimates 
require complicated parameterizations. It is nearly impossible to 
reconstruct or keep track of dependencies. Therefore, conservative 
approaches have become a popular solution to nonlinear data fusion. As a 
generalization of Covariance Intersection, exponential mixture densities 
have been widely applied for nonlinear fusion. However, this approach 
inherits the conservativeness of Covariance Intersection. For this 
reason, the less conservative fusion rule Inverse Covariance 
Intersection is studied in this paper and also generalized to nonlinear 
data fusion. This generalization employs a conservative approximation of 
the common information shared by the estimates to be fused. This bound 
of the common information is subtracted from the fusion result. In doing 
so, less conservative fusion results can be attained as an empirical 
analysis demonstrates.},

 abstract = {In this article, we are concerned with state estimation in Networked Control Systems where both control inputs and measurements are transmitted over networks which are lossy and introduce random transmission delays. We focus on the case where acknowledgment packets transmitted by the actuator upon reception of applicable control inputs are also subject to delays and losses, as opposed to the common notion of TCP-like communication where successful transmissions are acknowledged instantaneously and without losses. As a consequence, the state estimator in the considered setup has only partial and belated knowledge concerning the actually applied control inputs which results in additional uncertainty. We derive an estimator by extending an existing approach for the special case of UDP-like communication which maintains estimates of the applied control inputs that are incorporated into the estimation of the plant state. The presented estimator is compared to the original approach in terms of Monte Carlo simulations where its increased robustness towards imperfect knowledge of the underlying networks is indicated.},

 abstract = {State-of-the-art optical sorting systems suffer from delays between the particle detection and separation stage, during which the material movement is not accounted for. Commonly line scan cameras, using simple assumptions to predict the future particle movement, are employed. In this study, a novel prediction approach is presented, where an area scan camera records the particle movement over multiple time steps and a tracking algorithm is used to reconstruct the corresponding paths to determine the time and position at which the material reaches the separation stage. In order to assess the benefit of such a model at different operating parameters, an automated optical belt sorter is numerically modelled and coupled with the tracking procedure. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to describe the particle–particle as well as particle–wall interactions, while the air nozzles required for deflecting undesired material fractions are described with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The accuracy of the employed numerical approach is ensured by comparing the separation results of a predefined sorting task with experimental investigations. The quality of the aforementioned prediction models is compared when utilizing different belt lengths, nozzle activation durations, particle types, sampling frequencies and detection windows. Results show that the numerical model of the optical belt sorter is able to accurately describe the sorting system and is suitable for detailed investigation of various operational parameters. The proposed tracking prediction model was found to be superior to the common line scan camera method in all investigated scenarios. Its advantage is especially profound when difficult sorting conditions, e.g. short conveyor belt lengths or uncooperative moving bulk solids, apply.},

Filter (PBF), a novel stochastic filtering algorithm for nonlinear
spatial orientation estimation. As an extension of the orientation
filter previously proposed only for the identity measurement
model based on the Bingham distribution, our method is able to
handle arbitrary measurement models. Instead of the sampling-
approximation scheme used in the prediction step, a closed-
form solution is possible when the system equation is based on
the Hamilton product. Besides stochastic approaches, we also
introduce the Spherical Averaging Method (SAM), which is an
application of the Riemannian averaging technique. The two
approaches are then applied to a specific problem where the
wavefront orientation is estimated based on Time Differences of
Arrival (TDOA) and evaluated in simulations. The results show
theoretical competitiveness of the PBF.},

@article{arXiv18_Hanebeck,
 abstract = {We propose a homotopy continuation method called FLUX for approximating
complicated probability density functions. It is based on progressive
processing for smoothly morphing a given density into the desired one.
Distributed ordinary differential equations (DODEs) with an artificial time
$γ ın [0,1]$ are derived for describing the evolution from the initial
density to the desired final density. For a finite-dimensional
parametrization, the DODEs are converted to a system of ordinary
differential equations (SODEs), which are solved for $γ ın [0,1]$ and
return the desired result for $γ=1$. This includes parametric
representations such as Gaussians or Gaussian mixtures and nonparametric
setups such as sample sets. In the latter case, we obtain a particle flow
between the two densities along the artificial time.
FLUX is applied to state estimation in stochastic nonlinear dynamic
systems by gradual inclusion of measurement information. The proposed
approximation method (1) is fast, (2) can be applied to arbitrary nonlinear
systems and is not limited to additive noise, (3) allows for target
densities that are only known at certain points, (4) does not require
optimization, (5) does not require the solution of partial differential
equations, and (6) works with standard procedures for solving SODEs. This
manuscript is limited to the one-dimensional case and a fixed number of
parameters during the progression.
Future extensions will include consideration of higher dimensions and on the
fly adaption of the number of parameters.},

In general, the sensor nodes cannot keep track of the cross-correlations required to fuse estimates optimally. In this paper, a novel technique is presented that provides the means to reconstruct the required correlation structure. For this purpose, each node computes a set of deterministic samples that provides all the information required to reassemble the cross-covariance matrix for each pair of estimates. As the number of samples is increasing over time, a method to reduce the size of the sample set is presented and studied. In doing so, communication expenses can be reduced significantly, but approximation errors are possibly introduced by neglecting past correlation terms. In order to keep approximation errors at a minimum, an appropriate set size can be determined and a trade-off between communication expenses and estimation quality can be found.},

 abstract = {With the advent of cheap sensor technology, multisensor data fusion algorithms have been becoming a key enabler for efficient in-network processing of sensor data. The information filter, in particular, has proven useful due to its simple additive structure of the measurement update equations.
In order to exploit this structure for an efficient in-network processing, each node in the network is supposed to locally process and combine data from its neighboring nodes. The aspired in-network processing, at first glance, prohibits efficient privacy-preserving communication protocols, and encryption schemes that allow for algebraic manipulations are often computationally too expensive. Partially homomorphic encryption schemes constitute far more practical solutions but are restricted to a single algebraic operation on the corresponding ciphertexts. In this paper, an additive-homomorphic encryption scheme is used to derive a privacy-preserving implementation of the information filter where additive operations are sufficient to distribute the workload among the sensor nodes. However, the encryption scheme requires the floating-point data to be quantized, which impairs the estimation quality. The proposed filter and the implications of the necessary quantization are analyzed in a simulated multisensor tracking scenario.},

 abstract = {Transformation of a random variable is a common need in a design of many algorithms in signal processing, automatic
control, and fault detection. Typically, the design is tied to an assumption on a probability density function of the random variable,
often in the form of the Gaussian distribution. The assumption may be, however, difficult to be met in algorithms involving nonlinear
transformation of the random variable. This paper focuses on techniques capable to ensure validity of the Gaussian assumption of
the nonlinearly transformed Gaussian variable by approximating the to-be-transformed random variable distribution by a Gaussian
mixture distribution. The stress is laid on an analysis and selection of design parameters of the approximate Gaussian mixture
distribution to minimise the error imposed by the nonlinear transformation such as the location and number of the Gaussian mixture
terms. A special attention is devoted to the definition of the novel Gaussian mixture splitting directions based on the measures of
non-Gaussianity. The proposed splitting directions are analysed and illustrated in numerical simulations.},

 abstract = {For multisensor data fusion, distributed state estimation techniques that enable a local processing of sensor data are the means of choice in order to minimize storage and communication costs. In particular, a distributed implementation of the optimal Kalman filter has recently been developed. A significant disadvantage of this algorithm is that the fusion center needs access to each node so as to compute a consistent state estimate, which requires full communication each time an estimate is requested. In this article, different extensions of the optimally distributed Kalman filter are proposed that employ data-driven transmission schemes in order to reduce communication expenses. As a first relaxation of the full-rate communication scheme, it can be shown that each node only has to transmit every second time step without endangering consistency of the fusion result. Also, two data-driven algorithms are introduced that even allow for lower transmission rates, and bounds are derived to guarantee consistent fusion results. Simulations demonstrate that the data-driven distributed filtering schemes can outperform a centralized Kalman filter that requires each measurement to be sent to the center node.},

While state-of-the-art systems utilize scanning sensors such as line-scan cameras, advances in sensor technology have made application of area scanning sensors feasible. Provided a sufficiently high frame rate, objects can be observed at multiple points in time. By applying multiobject tracking, information about the objects contained in the material stream can be fused over time. Based on this information, our approach further allows predicting the position of each object for future points in time. While conventional systems typically apply a global, rather simple motion model, our approach includes an individual motion model for each object, which in turn allows estimating the point in time as well as the position when reaching the separation stage. In this contribution, we present results from our collaborative research project and summarize the present advances by discussing the potential of the application of area-scan sensors for sensor-based sorting. Among others, we introduce our simulation-driven approach and present results for physical separation efficiency for simulation-generated data, demonstrate the potential of using motion-based features for material classification and discuss real-time related challenges.},

@article{RTIP17_Maier,
 abstract = {Utilizing parallel algorithms is an established way of increasing performance in systems that are bound to real-time restrictions. Sensor-based sorting is a machine vision application for which firm real-time requirements need to be respected in order to reliably remove potentially harmful entities from a material feed. Recently, employing a predictive tracking approach using multitarget tracking in order to decrease the error in the physical separation in optical sorting has been proposed. For implementations that use hard associations between measurements and tracks, a linear assignment problem has to be solved for each frame recorded by a camera. The auction algorithm can be utilized for this purpose, which also has the advantage of being well suited for parallel architectures. In this paper, an improved implementation of this algorithm for a graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. The resulting algorithm is implemented in both an OpenCL and a CUDA based environment. By using an optimized data structure, the presented algorithm outperforms recently proposed implementations in terms of speed while retaining the quality of output of the algorithm. Furthermore, memory requirements are significantly decreased, which is important for embedded systems. Experimental results are provided for two different GPUs and six datasets. It is shown that the proposed approach is of particular interest for applications dealing with comparatively large problem sizes.},

 abstract = {The centralized Kalman filter can be implemented
in such a way that the required calculations can be distributed
over multiple nodes in a network, each of which processes
only the locally acquired sensor data. The main downside of
this implementation is that it requires each distributed sensor
node to communicate with the fusion center in every time step
so as to compute the optimal state estimate. In this paper,
two distributed Kalman filtering algorithms are proposed to
overcome these limitations. The first algorithm merely requires
communication of each local sensor node with the fusion center
in every other time step. The second algorithm even allows
for a lower communicate rate. Both algorithms apply event-based 
communication to compute consistent estimates and to
reduce the estimation error for a fixed communication rate.
Simulations demonstrate that both algorithms perform better in
terms of the mean squared estimation error than the centralized
Kalman filter.},

of Markov Jump Linear Systems (MJLS) via static output feedback. Because
the jump parameter is assumed not to be observed, the optimal control
law is nonlinear and intractable. Therefore, we assume the regulator to
be linear. Under this assumption, we first present sufficient
feasibility conditions for static output-feedback stabilization of MJLS
with non-observed mode in the mean square sense in terms of linear
matrix inequalities (LMIs). However, these conditions depend on the
particular state-space representation, i.e., a coordinate transform can
make the LMIs feasible, while the original LMIs are infeasible. To avoid
the issues with the ambiguity of the state-space representation, we
therefore present an iterative algorithm for the computation of the
regulator gain. The algorithm is shown to converge if the MJLS is
stabilizable via mode-independent static output feedback. However,
convergence of the algorithm is not sufficient for stability of the
closed loop, which requires an additional stability check after the
regulator gains have been computed. A numerical example demonstrates the
application of the presented results.},

Typically, involved sensors, illumination, implementation of data analysis and other components are designed and chosen according to the sorting task at hand. A common property of conventional systems is the utilization of scanning sensors. However, the usage of area-scan cameras has recently been proposed. When observing objects at multiple time points, the corresponding paths can be reconstructed by using multiobject tracking. This in turn allows to accurately estimate the point in time and position at which any object will reach the separation stage of the optical sorter and hence contributes to decreasing the error in physical separation. In this paper, it is proposed to further exploit motion information for the purpose of material characterization. By deriving suitable features from the motion information, we show that high classification performance is obtained for an exemplary classification task. The approach therefore contributes towards decreasing the detection error of sorting systems.},

model of an existing modular optical belt sorter is presented in this study. The sorter and particle
interaction is described with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) while the air nozzles required
for deflecting undesired material fractions are modelled with Computation Fluid Dynamics
(CFD). The correct representation of the resulting particle–fluid interaction is realized through
a one–way coupling of the DEM with CFD. Complex shaped particle clusters are employed to
model peppercorns also used in experimental investigations. To test the correct implementation
of the utilized models, the particle mass flow within the sorter is compared between experiment
and simulation. The particle separation results of the developed numerical model of the optical

specifically crafted to minimize communication between the
sensor nodes. As an adjusted version of the regular Kalman filter,
the distributed Kalman filter (DKF) allows for deriving optimal
results while not requiring regular communication. To achieve
this, the DKF requires that each node has full knowledge about
the system model and measurement models of all nodes. However,
the DKF is not sufficient if the characteristics of the errors in the
system and measurement models are not purely stochastic. In this
paper, we present a distributed version of a combined stochastic
and set-membership Kalman filter. The proposed filter optimizes
the approximations of the set-membership uncertainties and can
even yield better results than the regular centralized filter.},

networks, performing recursive Bayesian estimation using
distributed calculations is becoming more and more important.
There are a wide variety of algorithms catering to different
applications and requiring different degrees of knowledge about
the other nodes involved. One recently developed algorithm is
the distributed Kalman filter (DKF), which assumes that all
knowledge about the measurements, except the measurements
themselves, are known to all nodes. If this condition is met,
the DKF allows deriving the optimal estimate if all information
is combined in one node at an arbitrary time step. In this
paper, we present an information form of the distributed Kalman
filter (IDKF) that allows the use of explicit system inputs at
the individual nodes while still yielding the same results as a
centralized Kalman filter.},

Computation (ABC) paradigm. The main idea is to avoid the explicit

For this purpose, a large amount of particles in the state space is
simulated from the prior, transformed into measurement space,
and then compared to the real measurement by using an appropriate
distance function, i.e., the OSPA distance. By selecting the
closest simulated measurements and their corresponding particles
in state space, the posterior distribution is approximated. The
algorithm is evaluated in a multi-object scenario with and without
clutter and is compared to a global nearest neighbour Kalman

Among those solutions there is a class of estimators exploiting the fact that an event was not triggered. Not receiving a new measurement is then interpreted as a sensor signal that has not violated the event criteria, which means that the signal is still within the triggering set defining the event. Such implied measurement information is exploited by the estimator, though it is only valid when no event occurred. The approach is thus sensitive to package loss and latency, as the estimator might be incorrect in assuming that no event took place. A solution to anticipate for package loss on the estimation error is studied in this article, and it is further turned into a first solution when the estimator is part of a feedback-control loop.},

In this paper, we use the slight gap between the sensor lines of an RGB line scan camera to derive information about the particles' movements in real-time. This approach allows improving the predictions in optical belt sorters without necessitating any hardware modifications.},

An often encountered problem in the fusion process relates to unknown common information that is shared by the estimates to be fused and is responsible for correlations. If the correlation structure is unknown to the fusion method, conservative strategies are typically pursued. As such, the parameterization introduced by the ellipsoidal intersection method has been a novel approach to describe unknown correlations, though suitable values for these parameters with proven consistency have not been identified yet. In this article, an extension of ellipsoidal intersection is proposed that guarantees consistent fusion results in the presence of unknown common information. The bound used by the novel approach corresponds to computing an outer ellipsoidal bound on the intersection of inverse covariance ellipsoids. As a major advantage of this   inverse covariance intersection method, fusion results prove to be more accurate than those provided by the well-known covariance intersection method.},

By employing a permutation-invariant and differentiable point set distance measure, we derive a modified association-free multi-target measurement equation. It maintains the target identities but is invariant to permutations in the unlabeled measurements. Based on this measurement equation, we derive an efficient sample-based association-free multi-target Kalman filter. The proposed new approach is straightforward to implement and scalable.},

Systems tailored to a task at hand, for instance by means of sensors and implementations of data analysis. Conventional systems utilize scanning sensors which do not allow for extraction of motion-related information of objects contained in a material feed. Recently, usage of area-scan cameras to overcome this disadvantage has been proposed. Multitarget tracking can then be used in order to accurately estimate the point in time and position at which any object will reach the separation stage. In this paper, utilizing motion information of objects which can be retrieved from multitarget tracking for the purpose of classification is proposed. Results show that corresponding features can significantly increase classification performance and eventually decrease the detection error of a sorting system.},

 abstract = {State-of-the-art sensor-based sorting systems provide
solutions to sort various products according to quality
aspects. Such systems face the challenge of an existing delay
between perception and separation of the material. To reliably
predict an object's position when reaching the separation
stage, information regarding its movement needs to be derived.
Multitarget tracking offers approaches through which this
can be achieved. However, processing time is typically limited
since the sorting decision for each object needs to be derived
sufficiently early before it reaches the separation stage. In this
paper, an approach for multitarget tracking in sensor-based
sorting is proposed which supports establishing an upper bound
regarding processing time required for solving the measurement
to track association problem. To demonstrate the success of
the proposed method, experiments are conducted for data-sets
obtained via simulation of a sorting system. This way, it
is possible to not only demonstrate the impact on required
runtime but also on the quality of the association.},

It is shown that ellipsoidal intersection corresponds to an internal ellipsoidal approximation of the intersection of covariance ellipsoids.
An interesting result is that ellipsoidal intersection can be computed with the aid of the Bar-Shalom/Campo fusion formulae.

Like Kalman filters, the estimate of the PGF is a Gaussian distribution, but like particle filters, its measurement update works directly with the likelihood function in order to avoid the inherent linearization of the Kalman filters. However, compared to particle filters, the PGF allows for much faster state estimation and circumvents the severe problem of particle degeneracy by gradually transforming its prior Gaussian distribution into a posterior one. In this paper, we further enhance the estimation quality and runtime of the PGF by proposing a semi-analytic measurement update applicable to likelihood functions that only depend on a subspace of the system state. In fact, the proposed semi-analytic measurement update is not limited to the PGF and can be used by any nonlinear state estimator as long as its state estimate is Gaussian, e.g., the Gaussian particle filter.},

Based on the model, we apply a combination of constrained sample-based Kalman filtering and multi-target tracking techniques: 1) joint constraints imposed by the human body are satisfied by introducing a parameter transformation based on periodic functions, 2) a global nearest neighbor (GNN) algorithm computes the most likely one-to-one association between markers and measurements, and 3) multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) allows for a robust initialization that only requires an upright standing user. Evaluations clearly demonstrate that the proposed tracking provides highly accurate pose estimates in real-time, even for fast and complex motions.

The naive and intractable way of calculating the correct

measurement between all nodes. Instead, we propose to obtain
the correct correlations by keeping and processing a small set
of deterministic samples on each node in parallel to the actual
local state estimation. Sending these samples in addition to the
local state estimate to the fusion center allows for correctly
reconstructing the desired correlations between all estimates.
In doing so, each node does not need any information about
measurements processed on other nodes. We show the optimality

risks for overfitting. To alleviate this, we suggest to apply clustering
to the localization region of interest first and then use kernalbased

clustering is that the computational load for each cluster is also
significantly reduced. To further reduce the computational load
within each cluster, we also suggest to apply principal component
compression to the raw RSS measurements to reduce their
dimensionality. The rationale for applying principal component
compression is that the distributions of the RSS measurements
at all calibration points (CPs) within each cluster will be
more similar after clustering. Performance evaluation using both
simulated data and real data show that the extended kernelbased

In general, the estimation quality depends on the amount of sensor data that can be exploited.
However, missing observations do not necessarily impair the estimation quality but may also convey
exploitable information on the system state. This type of information - noted as negative
information - often requires specific measurement and noise models in order to take advantage of it.
In this paper, a hybrid Kalman filter concept is employed that allows using both stochastic and
set-membership representations of information. In particular, the latter representation is
intended to account for negative information, which can often be easily described as a bounded
set in the measurement space. Depending on the type of information, the filtering step of the
proposed estimator adaptively switches between Gaussian and ellipsoidal noise representations.
A target tracking scenario is studied to evaluate and discuss the proposed concept.},

of the globally growing material streams. The precise optical sorting of many
bulk solids is still difficult due to the great technical effort necessary
for transport and flow control. In this study, particle separation with an automated
optical belt sorter is modeled numerically. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used
to model the sorter and calculate the particle movement as well as
particle – particle and particle – wall interactions. The particle ejection stage with
air valves is described with the help of a MATLAB script utilizing particle movement information
obtained with the DEM. Two models for predicting the particle movement between
the detection and separation phase are implemented and compared. In the first model,
it is assumed that the particles are moving with belt velocity and without any cross movements
and a conventional line scan camera is used for particle detection. In the second model,
a more sophisticated approach is employed where the particle motion is predicted with
an area scan camera combined with a tracking algorithm. In addition, the influence of
different operating parameters like particle shape or conveyor belt length on the
separation quality of the system is investigated. Results show that numerical simulations
can offer detailed insight into the operation performance of optical sorters and help to
optimize operating parameters. The area scan camera approach was found to be superior to
the standard line scan camera model in almost all investigated categories.},

derived from an open-loop feedback (OLF) control setup, but
implements the fundamental property of closed-loop control

By using a finite set of representative measurements,
the feedback behavior is anticipated only on basis of current

implements an effective calculation to obtain a sequence of

A novel sample-based KF is the Smart Sampling Kalman Filter (S²KF). It is based on deterministic Gaussian samples which are obtained from an offline optimization procedure. Although this sampling technique is quite effective, it does not preserve the point symmetry of the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we overcome this issue by extending the S²KF with a new point-symmetric Gaussian sampling scheme to improve its estimation quality. Moreover, we also improve the numerical stability of the sample computation. This allows us to accurately approximate thousand-dimensional Gaussian distributions using tens of thousands of optimally placed and equally weighted samples. We evaluate the new symmetric S²KF by computing higher-order moments of standard normal distributions and investigate the estimation quality of the S²KF when dealing with symmetric measurement equations. Additionally, extended object tracking based on many measurements per time step is considered. This high-dimensional estimation problem shows the advantage of the S²KF being able to use an arbitrary number of samples independent of the state dimension, in contrast to other state-of-the-art sample-based Kalman Filters. Finally, other estimators also relying on the S²KF’s Gaussian sampling technique, e.g., the Progressive Gaussian Filter (PGF), will benefit from the new point-symmetric sampling as well.},

have to be assumed and ad hoc fixes must be used. In this work,
we develop computationally efficient recursive estimators that use the
Bingham distribution. This distribution is defined on the hypersphere
and is inherently more suitable for periodic problems. As a result,
these algorithms are able to consistently estimate orientation even in the
presence of large angular errors. Furthermore, handling of nontrivial
system functions is performed using an entirely deterministic method
which avoids any random sampling. A scheme reminiscent of the UKF
is proposed for the nonlinear manifold of orientations. It is the first
deterministic sampling scheme that truly reflects the nonlinear manifold
of orientations.},

the transformation of the state space and therefore, of the

 abstract = {To reduce the amount of data transfers
in networked systems, measurements can be taken at
an event on the sensor value rather than periodically
in time. Yet, this could lead to a divergence of estimation results when only the received measurement
values are exploited in a state estimation procedure.
A solution to this issue has been found by developing
estimators that perform a state update at both the event
instants as well as periodically in time: when an event
occurs the estimated state is updated using the measurement received, while at periodic instants the update is
based on knowledge that the sensor value lies within a
bounded subset of the measurement space. Several solutions for event-based state estimation will be presented
in this chapter, either based on stochastic representations
of random vectors, on deterministic representations of
random vectors or on a mixture of the two. All solutions aim to limit the required computational resources
by deriving explicit solutions for computing estimation
results. Yet, the main achievement for each estimation
solution is that stability of the estimation results are (not directly) dependent on the employed event sampling
strategy. As such, changing the event sampling strategy does not imply to change the event-based estimator
as well. This aspect is also illustrated in a case study
of tracking the distribution of a chemical compound
effected by wind via a wireless sensor network.},

The sensors may have non-overlapping fields of view in order to avoid interference.
Two major challenges are discussed. First, depending on where the object is
located relative to the sensor, the number and quality of the measurements strongly varies.
Second, a single depth sensor observes the calibration object only from one side.
Dealing with these challenges requires a simple calibration object as
well as an algorithm that can deal with under-determined measurements of
varying quality. A recursive Bayesian estimator is developed that determines the
extrinsic parameters by measuring the surface of a moving cube with
known pose. Our approach does not restrict the configuration of the network and
requires no manual initialization or interaction.
Ambiguities that are induced by the rotational cube symmetries are
resolved by applying a multiple model approach. Besides synthetic evaluation we
perform real data experiments and compare to state-of-the-art calibration.},

state is subject to specific constraints. In general, constraints
cannot easily be integrated into the prediction-correction structure
of the Kalman filter algorithm. Linear equality constraints
are an exception to this rule and have been widely used and
studied as they allow for simple closed-form expressions. A
common approach is to reformulate equality constraints into
pseudo measurements of the state to be estimated. However,
equality constraints define deterministic relationships between
state components which is an undesirable property in Kalman
filtering as this leads to singular covariance matrices. A second
problem relates to the knowledge required to identify and
define precise constraints, which are met by the system state.
In this article, ellipsoidal constraints are introduced that can
be employed to model a bounded region, to which the system
state is constrained. This concept constitutes an easy-to-use
relaxation of equality constraints. In order to integrate ellipsoidal
constraints into the Kalman filter structure, a generalized filter
framework is utilized that relies on a combined stochastic and
set-membership uncertainty representation.},

bulk materials that are hard to sort based on only nonvisual properties. In
this paper, we propose an extension to current optical belt sorters that
involves replacing the line camera with an area camera to observe a wider
field of view, allowing us to observe each particle over multiple time
steps. By performing multitarget tracking, we are able to improve the
prediction of each particle's movement and thus enhance the performance of
the utilized separation mechanism. We show that our approach will allow

accurate object pose and shape estimation. A star-convex RHM models the shape of an object with the aid of
a radial function that describes the distance from the object center to any point on its boundary. However,
up to now only linear estimators, i.e., Kalman Filters, are used due to the lack of a explicit likelihood function.
In this paper, we propose a closed-form and easy to implement likelihood function for tracking extended targets
with star-convex RHMs. This makes it possible to apply nonlinear estimators such as Particle Filters to estimate
a detailed shape of a target. We compared the proposed likelihood against the usual Kalman filter approaches
with tracking pose and shape of an airplane in 2D. The evaluations showed that the combination of the
Progressive Gaussian Filter (PGF) and the new likelihood function delivers the best estimation performance
and can outperform the usually employed Kalman Filters.},

In view of the Internet of Things and the vision of ubiquitous sensing, designing and implementing multisensor state estimation algorithm have already become a key issue. A network of interconnected sensor devices is usually characterized by the idea to process and collect data locally and independently on the sensor nodes. However, this does not imply that the data are independent of each other, and the state estimation algorithms have to address possible interdependencies so as to avoid erroneous data fusion results.
Dependencies among local estimates generally can be traced back to common sensor information and common process noise. A wide variety of Kalman filtering schemes allow for the treatment of dependent data in centralized, distributed, and decentralized networks of sensor nodes, but making the right choice is itself dependent upon analyzing and weighing up the different advantages and disadvantages. This chapter discusses different strategies to identify and treat dependencies among Kalman filter estimates while pointing out advantages and challenges.},

The main challenge in the solution is to find a good approximation to the arising stochastic
dynamic programming problem, which is computationally not tractable. In this work, future
information is considered in the form of conditional state probability densities. Thus,
the objective is it to optimize the state and its uncertainty as a combined problem.
We propose to discretize the state space by a novel scenario generation approach based on
deterministic sampling. A distance based threshold determines the narrowness of the discretization.
The dynamic programming problem is formulated such that the approximate cumulative control
cost function can be explicitly evaluated offline. The online calculation consists of a
one-step prediction and the interpolation of the explicit cost function in order to calculate
the control input. The effectiveness of this novel method is presented by means of a simulation.},

a lower bound on the true probability mass contained within the

is to consider factor-graph formulations of the underlying filtering and estimation setup.
While Kalman filter-based methods provide an estimate for the current pose of a robot and
all landmark positions, graph-based approaches take not only the current pose into account
but also the entire trajectory of the robot and have to solve a nonlinear least-squares
optimization problem. Using graph-based representations has proven to be highly scalable
and very accurate as compared with traditional filter-based approaches. However, biased
measurements as well as unmodeled correlations can lead to a sharp deterioration in the
estimation quality and hence require careful consideration. In this paper, a method to
incorporate biased or dependent measurement information is proposed that can easily be
integrated into existing optimization algorithms for graph-based SLAM. For biased sensor
data, techniques from ellipsoidal calculus are employed to compute the corresponding
information matrices. Dependencies among noise terms are treated by a generalization
of the covariance intersection concept. The treatment of both biased and correlated
sensor data rest upon the inflation of the involved error matrices. Simulations
are used to discuss and evaluate the proposed method.},

densities on periodic manifolds is, despite the compact domain, still an
open problem. We propose a novel filter for the circular case that performs
well compared to other state-of-the-art filters adopted from linear
domains. The filter uses a limited number of Fourier coefficients of the
square root of the density. This representation is preserved throughout
filter and prediction steps and allows obtaining a valid density at any
point in time. Additionally, analytic formulae for calculating Fourier
coefficients of the square root of some common circular densities are
provided. In our evaluation, we show that this new filter performs well in
both unimodal and multimodal scenarios while requiring only a reasonable
number of coefficients.},

Kalman Filter (S2KF) with a new point symmetric Gaussian sampling

computing higher-order moments of standard normal distributions and 
investigate the estimation quality of the S2KF when dealing with

on many measurements per time step is considered. This high-dimensional

of enumerating the cells of a hyperplane arrangement, which is a traditional problem from computational

of this new filter, a general introduction to Nonlinear Kalman
Filters based on statistical linearization and LRKFs is given.
The S²KF is based on a new low-discrepancy Dirac mixture

prises an arbitrary number of optimally and deterministically
placed samples in the relevant regions of the state space, so
that the filter resolution can be adapted to either achieve high-
quality results or to meet computational constraints. The S²KF
contains the UKF with equally weighted samples as a special case
when using the same amount of samples. With an increasing
number of samples, the new filter converges to the (typically
unfeasible) exact analytic statistical linearization. Hence, the
S²KF can be seen as the ultimate generalization of all LRKFs
such as the UKF, sigma-point filters, higher-order variants etc.,
as it homogeneously covers the state space with a freely chosen

target tracking system. Recently, it was proposed to extract
tracks with respect to the Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment
(OSPA) metric, i.e., the traditionally used squared error loss
is replaced with an OSPA loss, which leads to the so-called
Minimum Mean OSPA (MMOSPA) estimate. So far, work
concentrated on traditional trackers that maintain probability
densities for the targets. In this paper, we aim at extracting
the MMOSPA estimate from a Probability Hypothesis Density
(PHD) as used within the PHD filter. We elaborate that the PHD
in general does not contain enough information to determine
the exact MMOSPA estimate. However, we then show that if
the loss function has a specific form, it is indeed possible to
extract point estimates from a PHD that are optimal w.r.t. the
underlying unknown random finite set. We discuss two specific
loss functions that fulfill this condition and are potentially close
to the OSPA loss, a nearest neighbor loss and a kernel distance
loss. It turns out that track extraction based on the nearest
neighbor loss can be performed with the well-known k-means
algorithm. Simulations show when the estimates based on the
nearest neighbor and the kernel loss are close to the MMOSPA
estimate.},

linearly on the state estimate, while the feedforward term
depends on the initial system state and the constraint functions.
The control law can be partially given in closed-form that
can be precomputed offline, and a numerical part which
demands a solution of a quadratic optimization procedure.

evaluated by means of a Monte-Carlo simulation.},

unable to consider arbitrary circular correlations between
multiple angles so far. For this reason, we propose a novel
recursive filtering scheme that is capable of estimating multiple

two elements only. This is done by relating the underlying integrated

space consists of more than two elements we present three different 
ways to approximate the densities for the filter. The first approach is 
based on the continuous filter problem. The second approach is to derive 
a PDE for the densities and solve it numerically and the third approach 
is a crude discrete time approximation of the Markov chain. All three 
approaches are compared in a numerical study.},

advantage of the presented approach is that future information on the reference trajectory can
optimally be embedded in the predicted control sequences. Furthermore, the controller can be

 abstract = {Given a circular probability density function, called the true probability density
function, the goal is to find a Dirac mixture approximation based on some circular moments of
the true density. When keeping the locations of the Dirac points fixed, but almost arbitrarily
located, we are applying recent results on the circulant rational covariance extension problem
to the problem of calculating the weights. For the case of simultaneously calculating optimal
locations, additional constraints have to be deduced from the given density. For that purpose,
a distance measure for the deviation of the Dirac mixture approximation from the true density
is derived, which then is minimized while considering the moment conditions as constraints.
The method is based on progressive numerical minimization, converges quickly and gives well-
distributed Dirac mixtures that fulfill the constraints, i.e., have the desired circular moments.},

 abstract = {Distributed implementations of state estimation algorithms generally have in
common that each node in a networked system computes an estimate on the entire global
state. Accordingly, each node has to store and compute an estimate of the same state vector
irrespective of whether its sensors can only observe a small part of it. In particular, the task of
monitoring large-scale phenomena renders such distributed estimation approaches impractical
due to the sheer size of the corresponding state vector. In order to reduce the workload of the
nodes, the state vector to be estimated is subdivided into smaller, possibly overlapping parts.
In this situation, fusion does not only refer to the computation of an improved estimate but also
to the task of reassembling an estimate for the entire state from the locally computed estimates
of unequal state vectors. However, existing fusion methods require equal state representations
and, hence, cannot be employed. For that reason, a fusion strategy for estimates of unequal
and possibly overlapping state vectors is derived that minimizes the mean squared estimation
error. For the situation of unknown cross-correlations between local estimation errors, also a
conservative fusion strategy is proposed.},

estimation errors are correlated in general. Two extreme ways to
handle this correlation is either to ignore them completely or to
have them fully considered. There is another case in the middle:
it admits the existence of the correlation, but does not know how
large it is. A sensible way is to set up an optimality criterion
and optimize it over all possible such correlations. This work
is a new development in the third class. First, a new general
objective function is introduced, which is the minimum sum
of statistical distances between the fused density and the local
posterior densities. Then it is shown that the new criterion leads
to a convex optimization problem if the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence is used as the statistical distance between assumed
Gaussian densities. It is found that although the analytically
obtained fused estimate using the new criterion differs from
the simple convex combination rule only in mean squared error
(MSE) by a scaling factor N (the number of sensors used), it is
pessimistic semi-definite in MSE. Numerical examples illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed distributed fuser by comparing

distances between dynamic systems. In this formulation, the
OSPA distance finds the optimal assingment by minimizing over
the sum of distances between poles. The MAX-OSPA chooses
an optimal assignment by minimizing the maximum distance
between two poles. The proposed distances are evaluated in

 abstract = {For designing sample sets for nonlinear Kalman
filters, i.e., Linear Regression Kalman Filters (LRKFs), a new
method is introduced for approximating Gaussian densities by
discrete densities, so called Dirac Mixtures (DMs). This
approximating DM should maintain the mean and some higher-
order moments and should homogeneously cover the support
of the original density. Homogeneous approximations require
redundancy, which means there are more Dirac components than
necessary for fulfilling the moment constraints. Hence, some
sort of regularization is required as the solution is no longer
unique. Two types of regularizers are possible: The first type
ensures smooth approximations, e.g., in a maximum entropy
sense. The second type we pursue here ensures closeness of
the approximating density to the given Gaussian. As standard
distance measures are typically not well defined for discrete
densities on continuous domains, we focus on shifting the mass
distribution of the approximating density as close to the true
density as possible. Instead of globally comparing the masses as
in a previous paper, the key idea is to characterize individual
Dirac components by kernel functions representing the spread
of probability mass that is appropriate at a given location. A
distance measure is then obtained by comparing the deviation
between the true density and the induced kernel density. As a
result, the approximation problem is converted to an optimization
problem as we now minimize the distance under the desired
moment constraints.},

stationary heart, a stabilized image of the beating heart is shown to
the surgeon. Image stabilization cancels the unwanted motion of the
heart, but retains changes to color and texture, for example cuts on the
heart surface. In this paper, stabilization is first considered as a 2D
image transformation problem. Subsequently, it is extended to
stabilization of a 3D point cloud or surface. The proposed algorithms
are evaluated in both ex-vivo and in-vivo experiments. In the
evaluation, the stabilization quality achievable with several common
interpolation functions is compared.},

 abstract = {The problem of fusing state estimates is encountered in many network-based multi-sensor applications.
The majority of distributed state estimation algorithms are designed to provide multiple estimates on the
same state, and track-to-track fusion then refers to the task of combining these estimates. While linear
fusion only requires the joint cross-covariance matrix to be known, dependencies between estimates in
nonlinear estimation problems have to be represented by high-dimensional probability density functions.
In general, storing and keeping track of nonlinear dependencies is too cumbersome. However, this paper
demonstrates that estimates represented by Gaussian mixtures prove to be an important exception to this rule.
The dependency structure can as well be characterized in terms of a higher-dimensional Gaussian mixture.
The different processing steps of distributed nonlinear state estimation, i.e., prediction, filtering,
and fusion, are studied in light of the joint density representation. The presented concept is complemented
with different simpler suboptimal representations of the dependency structure between Gaussian mixture densities.},

to introduce augmented measurement vectors in the sensors

disadvantage of particle filtering is the computational load caused by
the large number of particles required for a sufficiently good
estimation. We address this issue by first expressing the probability
density that describes the state of the SHS as a collection of densities
of the continuous-valued state only conditioned on the discrete-valued
state. Then, we deterministically approximate these individual densities
with Dirac mixtures. The employed approximation method places the
particles so that a so called modified Cramér-von Mises distance
between the true and the approximated density is minimized.
Deterministic approximation requires far less particles than the
stochastic sampling used by particle filters. To avoid particle
degeneration that can occur when a density is multiplied with the
likelihood, the filter uses progressive density correction. The
presented filter is demonstrated in a numerical maneuvering target

continuous probability density function (pdf) by a Dirac mixture density. Optimal
parameters are determined by systematically minimizing a distance measure. As
standard distance measures are typically not well defined for discrete densities
on continuous domains, we focus on shifting the mass distribution of the
approximating density as close to the true density as possible. Instead of globally
comparing the masses as in a previous paper, the key idea is to characterize
individual Dirac components by kernel functions representing the spread of
probability mass that is appropriate at a given location. A distance measure is
then obtained by comparing the deviation between the true density and the induced
kernel density. This new method for Dirac mixture approximation provides
high-quality approximation results, can handle arbitrary pdfs, allows considering
constraints for, e.g., maintaining certain moments, and is fast enough for online
processing.},

and distributed systems by means of model predictive control (MPC).
The basic idea behind MPC is to repeatedly solve an optimal control
problem based on a model of the system to be controlled. Every time
a new measurement is available, the optimization problem is solved
and the corresponding input sequence is applied until a new measurement
arrives. As explained in the sequel, the advantages of MPC over other
control strategies for networked systems are due to the fact that
a model of the system is available at the controller side, which
can be used to compensate for random bounded delays. At the same
time, for each iteration of the optimization problem an optimal input
sequence is calculated. In case of packet dropouts, one can reuse
this information to maintain closed-loop stability and performance.},

usually tackled with traditional nonlinear filtering techniques such
as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) or the unscented Kalman filter
(UKF). Most of these techniques assume Gaussian distributions to
account for system noise and uncertain measurements. This distributional
assumption does not consider the periodic nature of pose and orientation
uncertainty. We propose a filter that considers the periodicity of
the orientation estimation problem in its distributional assumption.
This is achieved by making use of the Bingham distribution, which
is defined on the hypersphere and thus inherently more suitable to
periodic problems. Furthermore, handling of non-trivial system functions
is done using deterministic sampling in an efficient way. A deterministic
sampling scheme reminiscent of the UKF is proposed for the nonlinear
manifold of orientations. It is the first deterministic sampling
scheme that truly reflects the nonlinear manifold of the orientation.},

distributions defined on the proper manifold. In particular, we consider
objects moving along a closed one-dimensional track, for example an
ellipse, a polygon, or similar closed shapes. This shape is transformed
to a circle with a homeomorphism. Thus, we can apply a recursive
circular filtering algorithm to the constrained tracking problem.
Finally, the estimate is transformed back to the original manifold. We
evaluate the proposed method in an experiment by tracking a toy train
moving along a track and comparing the results to those of traditional

state into a single fused estimate. Dealing with multiple estimates
is one of the main concerns in distributed state estimation, where
an estimated value of the desired state vector is computed in each
node of a networked system. Most solutions for distributed state
estimation currently available assume that every node computes an
estimate of the (same) global state vector. This assumption is impractical
for systems observing large-area processes, due to the sheer size
of the process state. A more feasible solutions is one where each
node estimates a part of the global state vector, allowing different
nodes in the network to have overlapping state elements. Although
such an approach should be accompanied by a corresponding state fusion
method, existing solutions cannot be employed as they merely consider
fusion of two different estimates with equal state representations.
Therefore, an empirical solution is presented for fusing two state
estimates that have partially overlapping state elements. A justification
of the proposed fusion method is presented, along with an illustrative
case study for observing the temperature profile of a large rod,
though a formal derivation is future research.},

Traditional filters like the Kalman filter perform poorly because
they fail to take the periodic nature of the problem into account.
We present a recursive filter for directional data based on the Bingham
distribution in two dimensions. The proposed filter can be applied
to circular filtering problems with 180 degree symmetry, i.e., rotations
by 180 degrees cannot be distinguished. It is easily implemented
using standard numerical techniques and suitable for real-time applications.
The presented approach is extensible to quaternions, which allow
tracking arbitrary three-dimensional orientations. We evaluate our

it is possible to benefit from the advantages of different sensors.
The surface is obtained through interpolation of control points with
splines, which allows a compact representation of the surface. In
order to simplify the problem of intersecting the surface with lines
originating from the depth sensor, we propose the use of polar or
spherical coordinates in surface parameterization. The presented

an existing state estimator is extended so to cope with event-based
measurements successfully, i.e., curtail any diverging behavior in

event sampling is proposed. This formulation is used to set up a
state estimator combining stochastic as well as set-membership measurement
information according to a hybrid update: when an event occurs the
estimated state is updated using the stochastic measurement received
(positive information), while at periodic time instants no measurement
is received (negative information) and the update is based on knowledge
that the sensor value lies within a bounded subset of the measurement
space. An illustrative example further shows that the developed estimator
has an improved representation of estimation errors compared to a
purely stochastic estimator for various event sampling strategies.},

 abstract = {Almost all multi-target tracking systems have to generate point estimates
for the targets, e.g., for displaying the tracks. The novel idea
in this paper is to  consider point estimates for multi-target states
that are optimal according to a  kernel distance measure. Because
the kernel distance is a metric on point sets and ignores the target
labels, shortcomings of  Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimates
for multi-target states can be avoided. We show how the calculation
of  these point estimates can be casted as an optimization problem
and it turns out that it corresponds to the problem of reducing the
Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) function   to a Dirac mixture
density. Finally, we  discuss a generalization of the kernel distance
called LCD distance, which does not require to choose a specific
kernel width. The presented methods are evaluated in a  Multiple-Hypotheses
Tracker (MHT) setting with up to ten targets.},

ability to handle highly noise-corrupted systems has recently given
rise to stochastic control approaches. Besides providing high-quality
results within a noisy environment, these approaches have one problem
in common, namely a high computational demand and, as a consequence,
generally a short prediction horizon. In this paper, we propose to
reduce the computational complexity of prediction and value function
evaluation within the control horizon by simplifying the system progressively
down to the deterministic case. Approximation of occurring probability
densities by a specific representation, the deterministic Dirac mixture
density, with a decreasing resolution (i.e., approximation quality)
leads via natural decomposition to a point estimate and thus, can
be treated in a deterministic manner. Hence, calculation of the remaining
time steps requires considerably less computation time.},

a novel, easy to implement sequencebased control approach is proposed

order to model disturbances and errors. Either uncertainties are
modeled as stochastic quantities or they are characterized by their
membership to a set. Both approaches have distinct advantages and
disadvantages making each one inherently better suited to model different
sources of estimation uncertainty. This paper is dedicated to the
task of combining stochastic and set-membership estimation methods.
A Kalman gain is derived that minimizes the mean squared error in
the presence of both stochastic and additional unknown but bounded
uncertainties, which are represented by Gaussian random variables
and ellipsoidal sets, respectively. As a result, a generalization
of the well-known Kalman filtering scheme is attained that reduces
to the standard Kalman filter in the absence of set-membership uncertainty
and that otherwise becomes the intersection of sets in case of vanishing
stochastic uncertainty. The proposed concept also allows to prioritize
either the minimization of the stochastic uncertainty or the minimization
of the set-membership uncertainty.},

is applied to the decentralized control problem. The resulting approach
is proven to be optimal when the nodes have access to all information
in the network. More precisely, we utilize an algorithm for optimal
distributed estimation in order to obtain local estimates whose combination
yields the globally optimal estimate. When the interconnectivity
is high, the local estimates are almost optimal, which motivates
the application of the principle of separation. Thus, we optimize
the controller and finally obtain a flexible algorithm, whose quality
is evaluated in different scenarios. In applications where the strong
requirements on a perfect communication cannot be guaranteed, we
derive quality bounds by help of a detailed evaluation of the algorithm.
When information is regularly exchanged, it is demonstrated that
the algorithm performs almost optimally and therefore, offers system
designers a flexible and easy to implement approach. The field of
applications lies within the area of strongly networked systems,
in particular, when communication disturbances cannot be foreseen
or when the network structure is too complicated to apply optimized
regulators.},

Based on correspondences obtained by motion tracking, image stabilization
is considered as a scattered data interpolation problem. The proposed

 abstract = {We propose a principled algorithm for robust Bayesian filtering and
smoothing in nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems when both the transition
function and the measurement function are described by non-parametric
Gaussian process (GP) models. GPs are gaining increasing importance
in signal processing, machine learning, robotics, and control for
representing unknown system functions by posterior probability distributions.
This modern way of system identification is more robust than finding
point estimates of a parametric function representation. Our principled
filtering/smoothing approach for GP dynamic systems is based on analytic
moment matching in the context of the forward-backward algorithm.
Our numerical evaluations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed
approach in situations where other state-of-the-art Gaussian filters
and smoothers can fail.},

random variable X, it is possible to define the set of all distributions
that are compatible with the moments information. This set of distributions
can be equivalently characterized by its extreme distributions which
is a family of mixtures of Dirac's deltas. The lower and upper expectation
of any function g of X are obtained in correspondence of these extremes
and can be computed by solving a linear programming problem. The
filtering problem can then be solved by running iteratively this

In order to better utilize the potentials of both concepts, the core
element of this paper is a Kalman filtering scheme that allows for
a simultaneous treatment of stochastic and set-membership uncertainties.
An uncertain quantity is herein modeled by a set of Gaussian densities.
Since many modern applications operate in networked systems that
may consist of a multitude of local processing units and sensor nodes,
estimates have to be computed in a distributed manner and measurements
may arrive at high frequency. An algebraic reformulation of the Kalman
filter, the information filter, significantly eases the implementation
of such distributed fusion architectures. This paper explicates how
stochastic and set-membership uncertainties can simultaneously be
treated within this information form and compared to the Kalman filter,
it becomes apparent that the quality of some required approximations

 abstract = {The main problem of stochastic nonlinear model predictive control
(SNMPC) is that the equations for state prediction and calculation
of the expected reward are in general not solvable in closed form.
A popular approach is to approximate the occurring continuous probability
density functions by a discrete density representation, which allows
an analytical solution of the SNMPC equations. In this paper, we
propose to draw the samples not randomly as in Monte Carlo based
methods, but systematically by minimizing a distance measure. In
doing so, fewer components are generally required to represent the
underlying probability density while achieving the same approximation
quality. Especially if the evaluation of the expected reward is computationally
expensive, this property affects the complexity of computation significantly.
By means of a path planning problem, we have substantiated this statement
with several simulation runs.},

 abstract = {We consider stochastic model predictive control of a multi-agent systems
with constraints on the probabilities of inter-agent collisions.
First, we propose a method based on sample average approximation
of the collision probabilities to make the stochastic control problem
computationally tractable. Its approximation error vanishes for fixed
control inputs as the number of samples goes to infinity. However,
empirical results indicate that the complexity of the resulting optimization
problem can be too high to be solved under under real-time requirements.
To alleviate the computational burden we propose a second approach
that uses probabilistic bounds to determine regions of increased
probability of presence for each agent and introduce constraints
for the control problem prohibiting overlap of these regions. We
prove that the resulting problem is conservative for the original
problem, i.e., every control strategy that is feasible under our
new constraints will automatically be feasible for the true original
problem. Furthermore, we present simulations demonstrating better
run-time performance of our second approach compared to the sample
average approximation. Finally, we empirically show that our approach
is better suited than robust control approaches for situations in
which the systems under control are affected by stochastic disturbances.},

telepresence system and a microscopic pedestrian simulation is used
to simplify data collection. The extended range telepresence system
allows a user to move through a virtual environment by natural walking
instead of by using conventional input devices, like a joystick.
The telepresence system is connected to a pedestrian simulation which
produces real time 3D animated output which is presented to the user
with a head-mounted display (HMD) capable of showing 3D imagery.
The simulated pedestrians react to the user of the telepresence as
if it were another simulated pedestrian. With this system data about
pedestrian dynamics can be collected in experiments in which not
all participants need to be real people, but some - ideally all except
for one - can be simulated. This allows the general collection of
data about pedestrian dynamics but also to calibrate model specific
parameters. In this paper three experiments are introduced. However,
the focus of the contribution is to give an idea and an overview
of the combined telepresence-simulation system as data collection
tool.},

incorporating uncertainties affecting the system. Since stochastic
nonlinear model predictive control (SNMPC) problems in general cannot
be solved in closed form, either the system model or the occurring
densities have to be approximated. In this paper, we present an SNMPC
framework, which approximates the densities and the reward function
by their wavelet expansions. Due to the few requirements on the shape
and family of the densities or reward function, the presented technique
can be applied to a large class of SNMPC problems. For accelerating
the optimization, we additionally present a novel thresholding technique,
the so-called dynamic thresholding, which neglects coefficients that
are insignificant, while at the same time guaranteeing that the optimal
control input is still chosen. The capabilities of the proposed approach

deriving a recursive Gaussian state estimator for fitting conics
to data corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. For this purpose, the
original exact implicit measurement equation is reformulated with
the help of suitable approximations as an explicit measurement equation
corrupted by multiplicative noise. Based on stochastic linearization,
an efficient Gaussian state estimator is derived for the explicit
measurement equation. The performance of the new approach is evaluated
by means of a typical ellipse fitting scenario.},

As the required elimination of the complex dependencies between estimates
generally yields inconsistent results, several approaches, e.g.,
covariance intersection, maintain consistency by providing conservative
estimates. Unfortunately, these estimates are often too conservative
and therefore, much less informative than a corresponding centralized
approach. In this paper, we provide a concept that conservatively
decorrelates the estimates while bounding the unknown correlations
as closely as possible. For this purpose, known independent quantities,
such as measurement noise, are explicitly identified and exploited.
Based on tight covariance bounds, the new approach allows for an
intuitive and systematic derivation of appropriate tailor-made filter

to apply a symmetric state transformation to the original state in

entirely performs the time and measurement update in a transformed

quantities with unknown cross-correlations can be fused by means
of the covariance intersection algorithm, which avoids overconfident
fusion results. However, for nonlinear system dynamics and sensor
models perturbed by arbitrary noise, it is not only a problem to
characterize and parameterize dependencies between estimates, but
also to find a proper notion of consistency. This paper addresses
these issues by transforming the state estimates to a different state

dependencies between estimates, i.e., correlations, can arise. These
pseudo Gaussian densities then allow the notion of covariance consistency
to be used in distributed nonlinear state estimation.},

 abstract = {In order to assist a surgeon by operating on a beating heart, visual
stabilization makes the beating heart appear still to a surgeon by
providing the current heart view as stationary and non-moving. In
this way, the surgeon is not disturbed during an operation by a motion
of the heart and can get an impression of performing conventional
surgery. In contrast to existing methods for visual stabilization,
the proposed approach involves a model-based transformation of image
sequences provided by a camera system. This transformation incorporates
the knowledge of physical characteristics of the heart in form of
a mathematical model of the heart surface. Its main advantage is
that the uncertainties of the model and measurements are considered.
This occurs by estimating the parameters of the transformation. Furthermore,
the quality of the visual stabilization is additionally improved
by adapting the parameters of the underlying physical model. A performance
of the proposed approach is evaluated in an experiment with a pressure-regulated
artificial heart. In comparison to standard approaches, it provides
superior results illustrating the high quality of the visual stabilization.},

it is an algebraical reformulation of the Kalman filter and provides
estimates on the information about an uncertain state rather than

for nonlinear system and sensor models have been developed, approaches
towards nonlinear information filtering are still scarce and limited.
In order to deal with nonlinear systems and sensors, this paper derives
an approximation technique for arbitrary probability densities that
provides the same distributable fusion structure as the linear information

with constraints on the probabilities of inter-agent collisions.
We first study a sample-based approximation of the collision probabilities
and use this approximation to formulate constraints for the stochastic
control problem. This approximation will converge as the number of
samples goes to infinity, however, the complexity of the resulting
control problem is so high that this approach proves unsuitable for
control under real-time requirements. To alleviate the computational
burden we propose a second approach that uses probabilistic bounds
to determine regions with increased probability of presence for each
agent and formulate constraints for the control problem that guarantee
that these regions will not overlap. We prove that the resulting
problem is conservative for the original problem with probabilistic
constraints, ie. every control strategy that is feasible under our
new constraints will automatically be feasible for the original problem.
Furthermore we show in simulations in a UAV path planning scenario
that our proposed approach grants significantly better run-time performance
compared to a controller with the sample-based approximation with
only a small degree of sub-optimality resulting from the conservativeness
of our new approach},

Sensor Network (WSN) is considered. Persons carry on-body sensor
nodes and move within a WSN. The location of each person is calculated
on this node and communicated through the network to a central data
sink for visualization. Applications of such a system could be found in
mass casualty events, firefighter scenarios, hospitals or retirement homes for example.
For the location estimation on the sensor node, three derivatives of the
Kalman Filter and a closed-form solution (CFS) are applied, compared,
and evaluated in a real-world scenario. A prototype 65-node ZigBee WSN
is implemented and data are collected in in- and outdoor environments
with differently positioned on-body nodes. The described estimators are
then evaluated off-line on the experimentally collected data.
The goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive real-world evaluation of methods for
person localization in a WSN based on received signal strength (RSS) range measurements.
It is concluded that person localization in in- and outdoor environments is possible
under the considered conditions with the considered filters. The compared methods
allow for suffciently accurate localization results and are robust against
inaccurate range measurements.},

algorithms operating on sparse vectors are applicable and thus, a good
trade-off between approximation quality and run-time can be achieved.
Moreover, due to its highly generic nature, it can be applied to a large
class of nonlinear systems with a high modeling accuracy. In particular, the
noise acting upon the system can be modeled by an arbitrary probability
distribution and can influence the system in any way.},

 abstract = {A reliable estimation of heart surface motion
is an important prerequisite for the synchronization of surgical
instruments in robotic beating heart surgery. In general, only
an imprecise description of the heart dynamics and measurement
systems is available. This means that the estimation of heart
motion is corrupted by stochastic and systematic uncertainties.
Without consideration of these uncertainties, the obtained results
will be inaccurate and a safe robotic operation cannot be guaranteed.
Until now, existing approaches for estimating the motion of the
heart surface are either deterministic or treat only stochastic
uncertainties. The proposed method extends the heart motion
estimation to the simultaneous consideration of stochastic and
unknown but bounded systematic uncertainties. It computes dynamic

user in reaching a desired position in a remote environment of
arbitrary size without degrading the feeling of presence. Several
methods for haptic guidance are analyzed. With active haptic
guidance, the user is guided by superimposed forces that pull
him into the desired direction of motion, whereas under passive
haptic guidance, the movement of the user is lightened in the
preferred direction and constrained in the other directions. By
using closed-loop haptic guidance instead of open-loop haptic
guidance, not only is the user guided to his target but also
the deviation from the desired target path is reduced. The
proposed guidance methods were tested with a haptic interface
specifically designed for extended range telepresence.},

One major advantage of this approach is that the resulting likelihood function for this special problem is unimodal.
Hence, it is especially suitable for closely spaced targets.
The resulting estimation problem can be tackled with a standard nonlinear estimator.

 abstract = {Most existing approaches for tracking of the
beating heart motion assume known cardiac kinematics and
material parameters. However, these assumptions are not realistic
for application in beating heart surgery. In this paper,
a novel probabilistic tracking approach based on a physical
model of the heart surface is presented. In contrast to existing
approaches, the physical information about heart kinematics
and material properties is incorporated and considered in
an estimation of the heart behavior. An additional advantage
is that the time-dependencies and uncertainties of the heart
parameters are efficiently handled by exploiting simultaneous
state and parameter estimation. Furthermore, by decomposing
the state into linear and nonlinear substructures, the computational

@article{IJCARS10_Bogatyrenko,
 abstract = {Purpose: Tracking of beating heart motion in a robotic
surgery system is required for complex cardiovascular interventions.
Methods: A heart surface motion tracking method is developed,
including a stochastic physics-based heart surface
model and an efficient reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm
uses the constraints provided by the model that exploits
the physical characteristics of the heart. The main advantage
of the model is that it is more realistic than most standard
heartmodels. Additionally, no explicit matching between the
measurements and the model is required. The application of
meshless methods significantly reduces the complexity of
physics-based tracking.
Results: Based on the stochastic physical model of the heart
surface, this approach considers the motion of the intervention
area and is robust to occlusions and reflections. The
tracking algorithm is evaluated in simulations and experiments
on an artificial heart. Providing higher accuracy than
the standardmodel-based methods, it successfully copes with
occlusions and provides high performance even when all
measurements are not available.
Conclusions: Combining the physical and stochastic description
of the heart surface motion ensures physically correct
and accurate prediction. Automatic initialization of the physics-based
cardiac motion tracking enables system evaluation
in a clinical environment.},

known positions. The receiving times of the signal at the sensors correspond to the times of
arrival (TOA) plus an unknown offset, because the emission time is unknown.
Usually, for estimating the position of the object, the receiving times are
converted to a larger number of time differences of arrival (TDOA) in order
to eliminate the unknown offset. To avoid this conversion, the proposed
approach directly uses the receiving times. This is achieved by 1. determining the optimal offset from the redundant measurements in closed
form and 2. by considering a modified measurement equation. As a result,
position estimation can be performed by optimal stochastic linearization.},

subtracting receiving times of one receiver from another.
As TDOAs require intersecting hyperboloids, which is
considered a hard task, this paper follows a different ap-
proach, using raw receiving times. Thus, estimating the
signal's emission time is required, captured as a com-
mon offset within an augmented version of the system
state. This way, the multilateration problem is reduced
to intersecting cones. Estimation of the aircraft's posi-
tion based on a nonlinear measurement model and an
underlying linear system model is achieved using a lin-

putation of the filter step is introduced, allowing a more

 abstract = {Applying the Kalman filtering scheme to linearized system dynamics and observation models does in general not yield optimal state estimates.
More precisely, inconsistent state estimates and covariance matrices are caused by neglected linearization errors.
This paper introduces a concept for systematically predicting and updating bounds for the linearization errors within the Kalman filtering framework.
To achieve this, an uncertain quantity is not characterized by a single probability density anymore, but rather by a set of densities and accordingly,
the linear estimation framework is generalized in order to process sets of probability densities. By means of this generalization,
the Kalman filter may then not only be applied to stochastic quantities, but also to unknown but bounded quantities.
In order to improve the reliability of Kalman filtering results, the last-mentioned quantities are utilized to bound the typically neglected nonlinear parts of a linearized mapping.},

in general limited.  Therefore, an intelligent selection of sensors for
measurements is of great importance to ensure both high estimation
quality and an extended lifetime of the network. Methods from the theory
of model predictive control together with information theoretic measures
have been employed to pick sensors yielding measurements with high
information value. We present a novel information measure that originates from a
scalar product on a class of continuous probability densities and apply it
to the field of sensor management. Aside from its mathematical justifications
for quantifying the information content of probability densities, the most
remarkable property of the measure, an analogon of the triangle inequality
under Bayesian information fusion, is deduced. This allows for deriving
computationally cheap upper bounds for the model predictive sensor selection
algorithm and for comparing the performance of planning over different lengths of time horizons.},

step achieves optimal performance when no further assumptions can be made about the
system function. In addition, the proposed approach shows a much better convergence

stem from a point source. However, in many scenarios  this assumption
is not feasible so that measurements may stem from different locations,
named measurement sources, on the target surface. Then, it is necessary
to incorporate the target extent into the estimation procedure in
order to obtain robust and precise estimation results. This paper
introduces the novel concept of Random Hypersurface Models for extended
targets. A Random Hypersurface Model assumes that each measurement
source is an element of a randomly generated hypersurface. The applicability
of this approach is demonstrated by means of an elliptic target shape.
In this case, a Random Hypersurface Model specifies the random (relative)
Mahalanobis distance of a measurement source to the center of the
target object. As a consequence, good estimation results can be obtained
even if the true target shape significantly differs from the modeled
shape. Additionally, Random Hypersurface Models are computationally
tractable with standard nonlinear stochastic state estimators.},

 abstract = {In many tracking applications, the extent of the target object is neglected
and it is assumed that the received measurements stem from a point source. However,
modern sensors are able to supply several measurements from different scattering cen-
ters on the target object due to their high-resolution capability. As a consequence, it
becomes necessary to incorporate the target extent into the estimation procedure. This
paper introduces a new method for tracking the smallest enclosing rectangle of an ex-
tended object with an unknown shape. At each time step, a finite set of noisy position
measurements that stem from arbitrary, unknown measurement sources on the target
surface may be available. In contrast to common approaches, the presented approach
does not have to make any statistical assumptions on the measurement sources.},

A nonlinear filter, the Sliced Gaussian Mixture Filter (SGMF), employs linear
substructures in the nonlinear measurement and prediction model in order to
simplify the estimation process.
Here, a special density representation, the sliced Gaussian mixture
density, is used to derive an exact solution of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.
The sliced Gaussian mixture density is obtained by a systematic and deterministic
approximation of a continuous density minimizing a certain distance measure.
In contrast to previous work, improvements of the SGMF presented here include an
extended system model and the processing of multi-dimensional nonlinear
subspaces. As an application for the SGMF, cooperative passive target tracking,
where sensors take angular measurements from a target, is considered in this paper.
Finally, the performance of the proposed estimator is compared to the
marginalized particle filter (MPF) in simulations.},

on the nonlinear fusion model and only areas relevant to this

has advantages, especially when fusing Dirac mixture densities.
Within this approach, degeneration can be avoided
and even densities without mutual support can be combined.
Thus, this approach gives an alternative to multiplication of

methods, where pose estimation is performed on the basis of timeof-
flight (TOF) measurements between external sources and sensors
attached to the object, the proposed approach directly uses the amplitude
values measured at the sensors for estimation purposes without
an intermediate TOF estimation step. This is achieved by modeling
the wave propagation by a nonlinear dynamic system comprising a
system and a measurement equation. The nonlinear system equation
includes a model of the time-variant structure of the object rotation
based on rotation vectors. As a result, the measured amplitude values
at the sensors can be processed instantaneously in a recursive
fashion. Uncertainties in the measurement process are systematically
considered by employing a stochastic filter for estimating the
pose, i.e., the state of the nonlinear dynamic system.},

discrete-time signal values, is presented. The system description is the
solution of a linear partial differential equation (PDE). The PDE describes
for example the wave propagation of an acoustic wave in a localization
system. The solution of the PDE is given by a time-variant and space-variant
impulse response. This impulse response is characterized by the time and
space-variant parameters in order to track an object, which emits for example
an acoustic signal. For estimating the position of the object in an
instantaneous way a Bayesian approach has to be used, which considers the
dynamic behavior of the parameters in a system model and uncertainties in a
stochastic manner by means of probability density functions. Hence, the new
approach provides a probabilistic instantaneous model-based signal processing,
where the sequentially measured signal values are processed directly and known
reference signal sequences are interpreted as part of a time-variant nonlinear
measurement equation.},

 abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) and optimal control of systems with continuous
states and actions require approximation techniques in most interesting  cases.
In this article, we introduce Gaussian process dynamic programming '(GPDP), an
approximate value-function based RL algorithm. We consider both a classic optimal
control problem, where problem-specific prior knowledge is available,
and a classic RL problem, where only very general priors can be used.
For the classic optimal control problem, GPDP models the unknown value
functions with Gaussian processes and generalizes dynamic programming to continuous-valued
states and actions. For the RL problem, GPDP starts from a given initial state
and explores the state space using Bayesian active learning. To
design a fast learner, available data has to be used efficiently.
Hence, we propose to learn probabilistic models of the a priori unknown
transition dynamics and the value functions on the fly. In both
cases, we successfully apply the resulting continuous-valued controllers
to the under-actuated pendulum swing up and analyze the performances of the
suggested algorithms. It turns out that GPDP uses data very efficiently and
can be applied to problems, where classic dynamic programming would be cumbersome.},

calibration points before its start. Based on theoretical-propagation models (RF planning)
and on self-organizing maps (SOM) an adaptive approach for Simultaneous Localization and Learning (SLL)
has been developed. The algorithm extracts out of online measurements the true model of the RF propagation.
Applying SLL, a self-calibrating RSS-based positioning system with high accuracies can be realized
without the need of cost intensive calibration measurements during system installation or
maintenance. The main aspects of SLL are addressed as well as convergence and statistical
properties. Results for real-world DECT and WLAN setups are given, showing that the localization
starts with a basic performance slightly better than Cell-ID, finally reaching the accuracy of
pattern matching using calibration points.},

characterized by partial differential equations, which are monitored by sensor networks. The novelty of the
proposed reconstruction method is the systematic approach and the integrated treatment of uncertainties,
which occur in the physical model and arise naturally from noisy measurements. By this means it is possible
not only to reconstruct the entire phenomenon, even at non-measurement points, but also to reconstruct the
complete density function of the state characterizing the distributed phenomenon. In the first step, the
partial differential equation, i.e., distributed-parameter system, is spatially and temporally decomposed
leading to a finite-dimensional state space form. In the next step, the state of the resulting lumped-parameter
system, which provides an approximation of the solution of the underlying partial differential equation,
is dynamically estimated under consideration of uncertainties. By using the estimation results, several
additional tasks can be achieved by the sensor network, e.g. optimal sensor placement, optimal scheduling,
model improvement, and system identification. The performance of the proposed model-based reconstruction
method is demonstrated by means of simulations.},

Model Predictive Control (NMPC) that explicitly incorporates the
noise influence on systems with continuous state spaces is introduced.
By the incorporation of noise, which results from uncertainties during
model identification and measurement, the quality of control can be
significantly increased. Since stochastic NMPC requires the prediction
of system states over a certain horizon, an efficient state prediction
technique for nonlinear noise-affected systems is required. This is
achieved by using transition densities approximated by axis-aligned
Gaussian mixtures together with methods to reduce the computational burden.
A versatile cost function representation also employing Gaussianmixtures
provides an increased freedom of modeling. Combining the rediction technique
with this value function representation allows closed-form calculation of
the necessary optimization problems arising from stochastic NMPC. The
capabilities of the framework and especially the benefits that can be
gained by considering the noise in the controller are illustrated by the
example of a mobile robot following a given path.},

the logarithm of a Gaussian mixture and on a splitting method
of Gaussian mixture components. The employed order of the
Taylor-series expansion and the number of components used for
splitting allows balancing between accuracy and computational
demand. The second contribution is the determination of meaningful
and efficiently to calculate lower and upper bounds of the
entropy, which can be also used for approximation purposes.
In addition, a refinement method for the more important upper
bound is proposed in order to approach the true entropy value.},

processing of the underlying true continuous density functions.

of sensor networks based on local observations of a distributed
phenomenon. For the localization process, we propose the
rigorous exploitation of strong mathematical models of distributed
phenomena. By unobtrusively exploiting background
phenomena, the individual sensor nodes can be localized by
only observing its local surrounding without the necessity of
heavy infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce two novel
approaches: (a) the polynomial system localization method
(PSL-method) and (b) the simultaneous reconstruction and
localization method (SRL-method). The first approach (PSLmethod)
is based on restating the mathematical model of the
distributed phenomenon in terms of a polynomial system.
These equations depend on both the state of the phenomenon
and the node locations. Solving the system of polynomials
for each individual sensor node directly leads to the desired
locations. The second approach (SRL-method) basically regards
the localization problem as a simultaneous state and parameter
estimation problem with the node locations as parameters. By
this means, the distributed phenomenon is reconstructed and
the individual nodes are localized in a simultaneous fashion.
In addition, within this framework the uncertainties in the
mathematical model and the measurements are considered.
The performance of the two different localization approaches
is demonstrated by means of simulation results.},

phenomena observed by a sensor network. The centralized approaches are not scalable for large
sensor networks, because all information has to be transmitted to a powerful central processing node
requiring an extensive amount of communication bandwidth and a lot of processing power. Thus, for a
decentralized reconstruction of distributed phenomena, we propose a novel methodology consisting of
three steps: (a) conversion of the distributed phenomenon into a lumped-parameter system description,
(b) decomposition of the resulting system in order to map the description to the actual sensor network,
and (c) decomposition of the density representation leading to a decentralized estimation approach. The
main problem of a decentralized approach is that due to the propagation of local information through the
network, unknown correlations are caused. This fact needs to be considered during the reconstruction
process in order to get correct and consistent estimation results. For that reason, we employ a robust
estimator (based on Covariance Bounds) for the local reconstruction update on each sensor node. By this
means, the individual sensor nodes are able to estimate the local state of the distributed phenomenon
using local estimates obtained and communicated by adjacent nodes only. The information about their
correlations is not stored in the sensor network.},

discretize the DP value functions in order to be able to carry out the calculation. Especially
for multidimensional systems, either a large number of discretization points is necessary or
the quality of approximation degrades. This problem can be alleviated by interpolating the
discretized value function. In this paper, we present an approach based on optimal low-pass
interpolation employing sinc functions (sine cardinal). For the important case of systems with
Gaussian mixture noise (including the special case of Gaussian noise), we show how the
calculations required for this approach, especially the nontrivial calculation of an expected

list sensor scheduling (PLSS). This approach facilitates efficient
distributed estimation in sensor networks, even in case of unreliable
communication, by prioritizing the sensor nodes according
to local sensor schedules based on the predicted estimation
error. It is shown that PLSS minimizes the expected estimation
error for arbitrary packet-loss or transmission probabilities.
As prioritizing sensor nodes requires the calculation of several
sensor schedules, a novel pruning algorithm that preserves
optimal schedules is also derived in order to significantly reduce
the computational demand. This is accomplished by exploiting
the monotonicity of the Riccati equation and the information
contribution of individual sensor nodes in combination with a
branch-and-bound technique.},

method of discretizing states and controls suffers from the curse
of dimensionality and strongly depends on the chosen temporal sampling
rate. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian process dynamic programming
(GPDP) and determine an approximate globally optimal closed-loop
policy. In GPDP, value functions in the Bellman recursion of the
dynamic programming algorithm are modeled using Gaussian processes.
GPDP returns an optimal state-feedback for a finite set of states.
Based on these outcomes, we learn a possibly discontinuous closed-loop
policy on the entire state space by switching between two independently
trained Gaussian processes. A binary classifier selects one Gaussian
process to predict the optimal control signal. We show that GPDP
is able to yield an almost optimal solution to an LQ problem using
few sample points. Moreover, we successfully apply GPDP to the underpowered

linearly with the number of components. Computational savings are
even greater, when the required number of components, e.g., the minimum

by incorporating stochastic filters into the control. To develop
these kinds of algorithms and to prove their effectiveness, obviously
real-world experiments with real world uncertainties are mandatory.
Therefore, a test-environment for evaluating algorithms for collaborative

founded on miniature walking robots with six degrees of freedom.
Their novel locomotion concept not only allows them to move in a
wide variety of different motion patterns far beyond the possibilities
of traditionally employed wheel-based robots, but also to handle
real-world conditions like uneven ground or small obstacles. These
robots are embedded in a modular test-environment, comprising infrastructure
and simulation modules as well as a high-level control module with
submodules for pose estimation, path planning, and measurement scheduling.
The interaction of the individual modules of the introduced test-environment
is illustrated by an experiment from the field of cooperative localization
with focus on measurement scheduling, where the robots that perform

on the random variable of the measurement given the system state.
Unlike the likelihood, the conditional density is independent of
actual measurements, which permits determining its approximation
off-line. By treating the approximation task as an optimization problem,
we use progressive processing to achieve high quality results. Once
having calculated the conditional density, the likelihood can be
determined on-line, which, in turn, offers an efficient approximate
filter step. As result, a Gaussian mixture representation of the
posterior density is obtained. The exponential growth of Gaussian
mixture components resulting from repeated filtering is avoided implicitly
by the prediction step using the proposed techniques.},

degree uncertain. Therefore, a framework for Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (NMPC) is proposed that explicitly considers the noise influence
on nonlinear dynamic systems with continuous state spaces and a finite
set of control inputs in order to significantly increase the control
quality. Integral parts of NMPC are the prediction of system states
over a finite horizon as well as the problem specific modeling of
reward functions. For achieving an efficient and also accurate state
prediction, the introduced framework uses transition densities approximated
by means of axis-aligned Gaussian mixtures. The representation power
of Gaussian mixtures is also used to model versatile reward functions.
Thus, together with the prediction technique a closed-form calculation
of the optimization problems arising from NMPC is possible. Additionally,
an efficient algorithm for calculating an approximate value function
of the corresponding optimal control problem employing dynamic programming
is presented. Thus, the value function can be calculated off-line,
which reduces the on-line computational burden significantly and
also permits the use of long optimization horizons. The capabilities
of the framework and especially the benefits that can be gained by
incorporating the noise in the controller are illustrated by the

 abstract = {For several tasks in sensor networks, such as localization, information
fusion, or sensor scheduling, Bayesian estimation is of paramount
importance. Due to the limited computational and memory resources
of the nodes in a sensor network, evaluation of the prediction step
of the Bayesian estimator has to be performed very efficiently. An
exact and closed-form representation of the predicted probability
density function of the system state is typically impossible to obtain,
since exactly solving the prediction step for nonlinear discrete-time
dynamic systems in closed form is unfeasible. Assuming additive noise,
we propose an accurate approximation of the predicted density, that
can be calculated efficiently by optimally approximating the transition
density using a hybrid density. A hybrid density consists of two
different density types: Dirac delta functions that cover the domain
of the current density of the system state, and another density type,
e.g. Gaussian densities, that cover the domain of the predicted density.
The freely selectable, second density type of the hybrid density
depends strongly on the noise affecting the nonlinear system. So,
the proposed approximation framework for nonlinear prediction is
not restricted to a specific noise density. It further allows an
analytical evaluation of the Chapman-Kolmogorov prediction equation
and can be interpreted as a deterministic sampling estimation approach.
In contrast to methods using random sampling like particle filters,
a dramatic reduction in the number of components and a subsequent
decrease in computation time for approximating the predicted density
is gained.},

density functions by means of Dirac mixtures with equal weights is
proposed. The optimality of this approximation is guaranteed by minimizing
the distance of the approximation from the true density. For this
purpose a distance measure is required, which is in general not well
defined for Dirac mixtures. Hence, a key contribution is to compare
the corresponding cumulative distribution functions. This paper concentrates
on the simple and intuitive integral quadratic distance measure.
For the special case of a Dirac mixture with equally weighted components,
closed-form solutions for special types of densities like uniform
and Gaussian densities are obtained. Closed-form solution of the
given optimization problem is not possible in general. Hence, another
key contribution is an efficient solution procedure for arbitrary
true densities based on a homotopy continuation approach. In contrast
to standard Monte Carlo techniques like particle filters that are
based on random sampling, the proposed approach is deterministic
and ensures an optimal approximation with respect to a given distance
measure. In addition, the number of required components (particles)
can easily be deduced by application of the proposed distance measure.
The resulting approximations can be used as basis for recursive nonlinear
filtering mechanism alternative to Monte Carlo methods.},

densities contain all information about the stochastic dependencies
between their marginal densities in terms of a generalized correlation
parameter vector xi. The parameterized joint densities are applied
to the prediction step and the measurement step under imprecisely
known correlation leading to a whole family of possible estimation
results. The resulting density functions are characterized by the
generalized correlation parameter vector xi. Once this structure
and the bounds of these parameters are known, it is possible to find
bounding densities containing all possible density functions, i.e.,
conservative estimation results.},

directly from discrete-time sequences is introduced. The so called
probabilistic instantaneous matching algorithm recursively updates
the probability density function of the parameters for every received
sample and, thus, provides a high update rate up to the sampling
rate with high accuracy. In order to do so, one of the signal sequences
is used as part of a time-variant nonlinear measurement equation.
Furthermore, the time-variant nature of the parameters is explicitly
considered via a system equation, which describes the evolution of
the parameters over time. An important feature of the probabilistic
instantaneous matching algorithm is that it provides a probability
density function over the parameter space instead of a single point
estimate. This probability density function can be used in further
processing steps, e.g. a range based localization algorithm in the
case of time-of-arrival estimation.},

To avoid numerical problems, the two-point boundary-value

 abstract = {Recursive prediction of the state of a nonlinear stochastic dynamic
system cannot be efficiently performed in general, since the complexity
of the probability density function characterizing the system state
increases with every prediction step. Thus, representing the density
in an exact closed-form manner is too complex or even impossible.
So, an appropriate approximation of the density is required. Instead
of directly approximating the predicted density, we propose the approximation
of the transition density by means of Gaussian mixtures. We treat
the approximation task as an optimization problem that is solved
offline via progressive processing to bypass initialization problems
and to achieve high quality approximations. Once having calculated
the transition density approximation offline, prediction can be performed
efficiently resulting in a closed-form density representation with
constant complexity.},

probability density functions by means of Dirac mixtures. For that
purpose, a distance measure is required, which is in general not
well defined for Dirac mixture densities. Hence, a distance measure
comparing the corresponding cumulative distribution functions is
employed. Here, we focus on the weighted Cramer-von Mises distance,
a weighted integral quadratic distance measure, which is simple and
intuitive. Since a closed-form solution of the given optimization
problem is not possible in general, an efficient solution procedure
based on a homotopy continuation approach is proposed. Compared to
a standard particle approximation, the proposed procedure ensures
an optimal approximation with respect to a given distance measure.
Although useful in their own respect, the results also provide the
basis for a recursive nonlinear filtering mechanism as an alternative
to the popular particle filters.},

By using the estimation results, several additional tasks can be

with bounding the true density from below and from above by means

for ordering densities. Here, a partial ordering with respect to

can be regarded as a generalized correlation parameter. Unlike the

of the surroundings. Based on the user's hearing impairment, the
perception of the speaker in the focus of attention can be enhanced,
e.g. by amplification or using a speech-to-text conversion. A prototype
has been built for evaluating this approach. Currently the prototype
is able to locate sound beacons in three-dimensional space, to perform
a simple focus estimation, and to present floating captions in the

distributed parameter systems is the inclusion of recent discrete-time,

method for data processing is required that also handles incomplete
and noisy data, e.g. data from a sensor network. This article presents
two approaches to the reconstruction of distributed parameter systems
that can be described by linear partial differential equations (PDEs)
and involve one or several discrete measurement points. In both approaches,
the linear PDE is first converted into a bank of linear lumped systems
by means of modal analysis. In addition, a measurement equation relating
state and (sensor) data is derived. In the second step, a Kalman
filter (KF) is used to dynamically estimate the state of the lumped
systems, which provides an approximation of the solution of the underlying
PDE. The first approach uses Fourier Analysis. The second approach
uses Fourier Analysis and the collocation method. The approaches
are both demonstrated for a simple linear inhomogeneous PDE, the
one-dimensional heat equation.},

structured uncertainties in various applications. Many of these applications
have to deal with the fusion of uncertainties, an operation that
is usually performed by multiplication of these densities. The product
of Gaussian mixtures can be calculated exactly, but the number of
mixture components in the resulting mixture increases in an exponential
way. Hence, it is essential to approximate this resulting mixture
with less components, to keep it tractable for further processing
steps. This paper introduces an approach to approximate the exact
product with a mixture that uses less components. The maximum approximation
error can be chosen by the user. This choice allows to trade accuracy
of the approximation for the number of mixture components used. This
is possible due to the usage of a progressive processing scheme that
calculates the product operation by means of a system of ordinary
differential equations. The solution of this system yields the parameters
of the desired Gaussian mixture.},

of machines and compensating them by appropriate adjustment. This
paper introduces a model- based measurement framework for improving
calibration procedures of machine tools. The goal is to precisely
estimate the mechanical depciencies based on a minimal number of
measurements. For that purpose, the mechanical depciencies of linear
and rotary joints are modeled using splines. Uncertainties of the
depciency model are formulated stochastically, which allows incorporation
of imprecise measurement data and prediction of optimal measurement
parameters. We derive a method for optimally estimating a set of
splines, i.e., joint errors, based on a set of measurements and for
predicting the optimal joint configuration for new measurements.},

impression of being present in a remote environment. This
is achieved by having a robot, that is actually present in the
remote environment, gather visual data. This data is presented
to the user, who is wearing a head mounted display. In order
to extend telepresence to an intuitive user interface for robot
teleoperation, the user's motion is tracked and replicated by
the robot. The user can now interact more naturally with
the remote environment simply by walking around. Without
further processing of the motion data, the size of the remote
environment is limited to the size of the user environment.
Using the motion compression algorithm allows users to be
telepresent in large target environments while the size of the
user environment is limited. However, as a consequence of
the influence of standard motion compression on the user's
natural navigation, he tends to leave the desired path. This can
even lead to users leaving the user environment. We address
this problem by introducing controlled motion compression
which adds a feedback controller to motion compression.
This controller modifies the user's perception of the target
environment in such a way, that he is controlled on the path.},

exhibitions, architecture, or industrial sites with a high degree of realism.
While walking freely around in the user environment, the user sees the
remote environment through the eyes of a remote mobile teleoperator.
For that purpose, the user's motion is tracked and transferred to the
teleoperator. Without additional processing of the motion data, the size of
the remote environment to be explored is limited to the size of the user environment.
This paper proposes an extension of telepresent walking to arbitrarily large remote
or virtual spaces based on compressing wide-area motion into the available user space.
Motion compression is a novel approach and does not make use of scaling or
walking-in-place metaphors. Rather, motion compression introduces some deviation of
curvature between user motion and teleoperator motion. An optimization approach is
used to find the user path of minimum curvature deviation with respect to a given
predicted teleoperator path that fits inside the boundaries of the user environment.
Turning angles and travel distances are mapped with a 1:1 ratio to provide the desired
impression of realistic self-locomotion in the teleoperator's environment.
The effects of the curvature deviation on inconsistent perception of
locomotion are studied in two experiments.},

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with recursively estimating the internal state
sequence of a discrete-time dynamic system by processing a sequence
of noisy measurements taken from the system output. Recursive processing
requires some kind of sufficient statistic for representing the information
collected up to a certain time step. For this purpose, the probability
density functions of the state are especially well suited. Once they
are available, almost any type of point estimate, e.g. mean, mode,
or median, can be derived. In the case of continuous states, however,
the exact probability density functions characterizing the state
estimate are in general either not feasible or not well suited for
recursive processing. Hence, approximations of the true densities
are generally inevitable, where Gaussian mixture approximations are
convenient for a number of reasons. However, calculating appropriate
mixture parameters that minimize a global measure of deviation from
the true density is a tough optimization task. Here, we propose a
new approximation method that minimizes the squared integral deviation
between the true density and its mixture approximation. Rather than
trying to solve the original problem, it is converted into a corresponding
system of explicit ordinary first-order differential equations. This
system of differential equations is then solved over a finite time
interval, which is an efficient way of calculating the desired optimal
parameter values. We focus on the measurement update in the important
case of vector states and scalar measurements. In addition, approximation
densities with separable kernels are assumed. It will be shown, that
if the measurement nonlinearities are also separable, the required
multidimensional integrals can be reduced to the product of one-dimensional
integrals. For several important types of measurement functions including
polynomial measurement nonlinearities, closed-form analytic expressions
for the coefficients of the system of differential equations are
available.},

for the distance to the serving base station. Second, the signal
strengths (RXLEV) of neighbouring base stations can also be
interpreted as distance information. Both TA and RXLEV are
subject to measurement errors caused for example by shadowing,
reflections, and fast fading. Thus, a nonlinear set-theoretic
estimation technique based on pseudo ellipsoids is applied. The
uncertainty regions in the original space defined by the measurements
are transformed into a hyperspace of higher dimension
and described by pseudo ellipsoids. An approximation of
the set intersection of the pseudo ellipsoids can be calculated
recursively by a linear set-theoretic filter. The resulting pseudo
ellipsoid is transformed back into the original space, and the
position estimate is calculated as center of gravity of the resulting
uncertainty region. The algorithm is evaluated based on
the data of an extensive field trial in a rural area. Compared
to Cell ID, the accuracy is significantly increased by using TA
and RXLEV, reducing the mean error by half.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the state of a discrete-time
dynamic system comprising a linear system equation and a nonlinear measurement
equation based on measurements corrupted by non-Gaussian noise. The problem is
solved by recursively calculating the complete posterior density of the state given
the measurements. For representing the resulting non-Gaussian posterior, a new
exponential type density, the so called pseudo Gaussian density, is introduced. By
converting the original nonlinear system to an equivalent linear representation in
a higher-dimensional space, the parameters of the pseudo Gaussian posterior are
obtained by means of a linear estimator operating in the higher-dimensional space.
The resulting filtering algorithms are easy to implement and always guarantee valid
posterior densities.},

not be possible to obtain. Even when available, it may be
too complex or not practical because, for example, recursive
application is required. Hence, approximations are generally
inevitable. Gaussian mixture approximations are convenient
for a number of reasons. However, calculating appropriate
mixture parameters that minimize a global measure of deviation
from the true density is a tough optimization task. Here,
we propose a new approximation method that minimizes the
squared integral deviation between the the true density and
its mixture approximation. Rather than trying to solve the
original problem, it is converted into a corresponding system
of explicit ordinary first-order differential equations. This
system of differential equations is then solved over a finite
"time" interval, which is an efficient way of calculating the
desired optimal parameter values. For polynomial measurement
nonlinearities, closed-form analytic expressions for the
coefficients of the system of differential equations are derived.},

 abstract = {A mobile interface for physical interaction with extended real or
virtual environments is presented, which frees the operator from being bound to
a stationary workstation. The operator's unrestricted walking is available as input
to the locomotion control of the teleoperator or the avatar. Hence, the operator
uses proprioceptive perception of locomotion, which is required for navigation and
wayfinding. To allow unrestricted local locomotion, the haptic interface moves
along with the operator. This could be achieved by using a portable kinesthetic
interface, which, however, is not capable of displaying large external forces.
A mobile haptic interface, which actively follows the operator's locomotion.
The corresponding locomotion platform is continuously positioned in such a way
that maximum manipulability is guaranteed. In order to accomplish this under
the kinematic and dynamic restrictions of the wheel-based platform, the operator's
intention of locomotion is predicted. A prototype telepresence system for
kinesthetic exploration of extended virtual environments has been designed
according to the proposed paradigm, implemented, and tested.},

Solutions are given for the most general case

The measurements depend nonlinearly on the state and are corrupted

calculating the complete posterior density of the state given the
measurements. For that purpose, a new exponential type density is
introduced, the so called pseudo Gaussian density, which is used
to represent the complicated non-Gaussian posterior densities resulting
from the recursion. For polynomial measurement nonlinearities and
pseudo Gaussian noise densities, it is shown that the result of the
optimal Bayesian measurement update is exactly obtained by a Kalman
filter operating in a higher dimensional space. The resulting filtering
